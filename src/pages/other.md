# Independent Curatorial Work
<h2>With/out</h2><br>

<img src="/imgs/without-01.jpg" width="100%">


<span class="semibold">With/out</span> was a one night exhibition of sound-based art, presented outdoors through a simple stereo amplifier and two small speakers. A group of artists, musicians, and writers created new audio works specifically for presentation there.

Despite being recorded works, there is no option to download, stream or otherwise listen to these works outside of the live presentation. Gathering together and listening carefully in the moment was required.

<img src="/imgs/without-03.jpg" width="49.5%"> <img src="/imgs/without-04.jpg" width="49.5%">

A free 16 page program with ancillary text and visual material from each of the artists involved was available for attendees. A PDF copy can be viewed here. (temporarily unavailable)

The event took place in Glen Echo Park, under the Indianola Avenue “Bird” bridge in Columbus, Ohio on Sunday June 24th.
